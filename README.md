# unity_firstPersonMovement
First person movement script for unity.

This is not intended for first person movement for a movement based game.
This is useful for moving the camera around in the game as if it was in the editor.
Attach script directly to main camera you want to move around in the running game scene.

# Controls
The inputs are independent to the input manager, so these controls should remain even if input controls have been changed.

W = Forward <br/>
A = Left <br/>
S = Back <br/>
D = Right <br/>
Space bar = Up <br/>
CTRL = Down <br/>
Shift = Speed boost <br/>

P = Pause camera look
