# unity_firstPersonMovement
First person movement script for unity.

This is not good for first person movement for a movement based game.
This is useful for moving the camera around in the game as if it was in the editor.
Attach script directly to main camera you want to move around in the game scene.

# Controls
The inputs are independant of the input manager, so these controls should remain even if input controls have been changed.

W = Foward 
A = Left
S = Back
D = Right
Space bar = Up
CTRL = Down
Shift = Speed boost
